# MobileRobotsThesis

This thesis explores the development of a distributed fleet management system for mobile robots using ROS 2, focusing on efficient multi-robot navigation, task allocation, and coordination. The project employs a master-slave architecture where a central master node manages navigation graphs, computes Closed Postman Problem (CPP) routes, and dynamically assigns waypoints to slave robots based on availability and edge occupancy. Slave robots execute navigation commands and communicate status updates, ensuring robust task execution across the fleet. The system's design integrates graph theory, clustering techniques, and real-time communication to optimize path traversal while preventing conflicts. This work demonstrates practical applications in autonomous robot fleets for logistics, surveillance, and other dynamic environments.
