class MasterNavigationNode(Node, MasterCallbacks):
    """
    MasterNavigationNode is a ROS2 node responsible for managing a fleet of slave robots.
    
    This node performs the following key functions:
      - Loads and publishes the navigation graph.
      - Registers and tracks slave robots.
      - Computes and assigns waypoints to slaves.
      - Monitors slave heartbeats to detect and handle inactive slaves.
      - Manages the occupancy of edges in the navigation graph to prevent task conflicts.
    
    The node inherits from both `Node` (a fundamental ROS2 class) and `MasterCallbacks` 
    (which provides callback methods for handling slave interactions and navigation tasks).
    
    Attributes:
        graph_path (str): Path to the JSON file containing the navigation graph.
        check_interval (float): Interval in seconds for periodic checks (e.g., slave timeouts).
        timeout (float): Time in seconds after which a slave is considered inactive if no heartbeat is received.
        full_graph (nx.MultiGraph): The complete navigation graph loaded from the JSON file.
        graph_publisher (Publisher): Publisher for broadcasting the navigation graph.
        graph_timer (Timer): Timer to periodically publish the navigation graph.
        slave_registration_subscriber (Subscriber): Subscriber for receiving slave registration messages.
        navigation_status_subscriber (Subscriber): Subscriber for receiving navigation status updates from slaves.
        heartbeat_manager (HeartbeatManager): Manages heartbeat publishing for the master node.
        waypoint_manager (WaypointManager): Manages waypoint assignments to slaves.
        timer (Timer): Timer for performing periodic maintenance tasks.
        slaves (dict): Dictionary mapping slave namespaces to their respective `SlaveState` instances.
        partitioning_done (bool): Flag indicating whether graph partitioning has been completed.
        occupied_edges (set): Set of edges currently assigned to slaves to prevent overlapping tasks.
        edge_occupants (dict): Dictionary mapping occupied edges to the slave namespaces that occupy them.
            Queste due variabili lavorano in sinergia per garantire una gestione efficiente e senza conflitti dei compiti di navigazione all'interno della flotta di robot. Assicurandoti 
            che gli edge siano correttamente assegnati e gestiti, puoi prevenire problemi come l'assegnazione di edge fittizi o sovrapposti, migliorando la robustezza e l'affidabilit√† del sistema 
            di navigazione.
        edge_last_visit_time (dict): Dictionary tracking the last time each edge was traversed (optional).

        Steps performed during initialization:
          1. Initializes the ROS2 node with the name 'master_navigation_node'.
          2. Initializes the MasterCallbacks class to set up callback methods.
          3. Declares and retrieves ROS2 parameters: graph_path, check_interval, and timeout.
          4. Validates the existence of the navigation graph file.
          5. Loads the navigation graph using `load_full_graph`.
          6. Sets up publishers and subscribers for graph distribution and slave management.
          7. Initializes HeartbeatManager and WaypointManager for managing heartbeats and waypoints.
          8. Sets up a periodic timer for maintenance tasks such as checking slave timeouts and assigning waypoints.
          9. Initializes tracking structures for slaves and edge occupancy.
          10. Resets occupied edges and occupants to ensure a clean start.
          11. Subscribes to '/first_waypoint_reached' to handle first waypoint notifications from slaves.
